You sit there stone-faced

as if I'm not here

Can't you see

that I've been crying?

I didn't know you'd be insane

Dreams can be so deceiving

You're an itch I can't reach

A wound that won't heal

The smell of skin, that's burning

I didn't know you'd be insane

But it's true

And just say all I am to you

is a pain in my neck

Thorn in my side

Stain on my blade

Blood on my knife

Been dreaming of her

all of my life

But she won't come true

She's just my nightmare I woke up to

She's twisted, he's a rebel

She's sick, he's hard to handle

But worst of all is she just don't care

She's twisted like a rope

That is wrapped around his throat

But still worst part of

all is she really don't give a

(She don't give a \*\*\*\*)

Sometimes I wish that you would just die

Cause I'm too afraid of leaving

I didn't know you'd be insane

Dreams can be so deceiving

(How did it come to this?

Why do I fantasize to kill you

when you're sleeping?)

I didn't know you feel the same

When I say you're no good

all you are to me

is a pain in my neck,

Thorn in my side

Stain on my blade

Blood on my knife

Been dreaming of her

all of my life

But she won't come true

She's just my nightmare I woke up to

She's twisted, he's a rebel

She's sick, he's hard to handle

But worst of all is he just don't care

She's twisted like a rope

That is wrapped around his throat

But still worst part of

all is she really don't give a

Love ain't no fairytale

Love is a buried nail

Inside of this heart of stone

So you wanna get married? Well

Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio

In the back alley takin' shots

of whiskey and only gold

Juliet's at the nudie bar

Doin' God only knows

Neither one of 'em came to see the dog

and the pony show

But a **\*** is a **\***

And a horse is a horse

ain't it? sorry, I can't afford

to get your daddy's old Porsche painted

Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'

If a dollar makes you holler

well then I'm gettin' the short change of it, uh

Feel like I've been asleepin' alone

And lovin' this angel

Entangled between a dream and a coma

Walkin' the edge of this cliff

Like a sheep to it's owner

Then woke up to

this **\*\***' **\*** with an evil persona

Now if you say that you hate somebody

and you livin' with them

Then they pack up and leave

and you **\*** about how you miss 'em

You gotta see the pattern

of the blood all over the steerin' wheel

Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel

'Round and 'round we roll,

Where it stops, baby nobody knows

Some people go crazy

and they lose control

Some people jump off

Some people won't let go

Some people say love

Some people say why

Some people don't love

They just want a free ride

The rain won't stop

It'll never dry

If she's in the house of pain

Then love is standin' outside

She's twisted, he's a rebel

She's sick, he's hard to handle

But worst of all is he just don't care

She's twisted like a rope

That is wrapped around his throat

But still worst part of

all is she really don't give a

(She don't give a \*\*\*\*)

But maybe I'm the twisted one

that screwed this up

So I guess this means Goodbye,

for now, _laughter_

Given the sum and gcd of two numbers, return those two numbers in ascending order. If the numbers do not exist, return -1, (or NULL in C, tuple (-1,-1) in C#, pair (-1,-1) in C++, array {-1,-1} in Java and Golang).

For example: Given sum = 12 and gcd = 4... solve(12,4) = [4,8]. The two numbers 4 and 8 sum to 12 and have a gcd of 4. solve(12,5) = -1. No two numbers exist that sum to 12 and have gcd of 5. solve(10,2) = [2,8]. Note that [4,6] is also a possibility but we pick the one with the lower first element: 2 < 4, so we take [2,8].
