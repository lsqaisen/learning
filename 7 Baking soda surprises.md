Also known as `sodium bicarbonate` or `bicarbonate of soda`, baking soda is often `employed` as a `leavening agent`, since it’s involved in the chemical reaction that causes dough to rise. But this `household` `staple` has hundreds of uses. Baking soda is somewhat alkaline—that is, it has a pH above 7 and thus helps neutralize acids, including acidic `scent` `molecules`. That’s why baking soda `comes in handy` in the following (and surprising) ways:

> 小苏打又被叫做`碳酸氢钠`，经常当作一种`发酵剂`被`使用`，自从它参加面团膨胀的化学反应。但是这种`家庭` `主食`有着千百种用法。小苏打是有点碱性，就是说，他的 ph 大于 7，因此可以中和酸，包括酸性`气味` `分子`。这就是为什么小苏打在下面（惊奇的）方法中`派上用场`：

1. An open box of baking soda can help `deodorize` a refrigerator or room. You can make an air freshener by mixing baking soda and water in a `spray` `bottle`.

> 一盒打开的小苏打可以帮助`祛除`冰箱或房间`的异味`。你可以制作一瓶空气清新剂通过在`喷雾` `瓶`混合小苏打和水。

2. It has various uses in cooking, not just baking. Adding a pinch to the soaking water of beans speeds the cooking process and helps reduce `compounds` that cause `flatulence`. A pinch added to tomato sauce while cooking, or coffee while `brewing`, reduces acidity. It’s also an `effective` meat `tenderizer`, since it `breaks down proteins`.

> 小苏打在烹饪中有各种各样的用途，不只是烘烤。加一小撮在浸泡豆子的水中加速烹饪过程 并且有助于减少导致`肠胃气胀`的`化合物`。烹制番茄酱或者`冲泡`咖啡时加一小撮减少酸性。它也是一种`有效的`肉类`嫩滑剂`，因为它可以`分解蛋白质`。

3. Because it’s a mild abrasive and deodorizer, baking soda is a gentle, inexpensive cleanser for sinks, tiles, toilet bowls and ovens. And it’s a good ingredient in toothpastes, underarm deodorants and denture soaks. Environmentally safe, baking soda can be used in place of potentially toxic products.

> 因为它是适度的研磨剂和除臭剂，小苏打对于水槽、瓷砖、马桶、烤箱是温和的便宜的清洁剂。并且它是一个好的成分在牙膏，腋下除臭剂中和假牙浸泡。有关环境方面的安全，小苏打可以被用作代替潜在的有毒商品。

4. When added to laundry water—about half a cup—it can improve the effectiveness of detergent. Added to the rinse cycle, it can neutralize odors.

> 当添加到洗衣水中（大约半杯），它可以增加清洁剂的效力。添加到票息周期中，它可以中和气味。

5. Added to bath water, baking soda soothes dry skin, sunburn and itching due to poison ivy or mosquito bites. Or, it can be applied as a paste (one part water to three parts baking soda).

> 添加到洗澡水中，小苏打缓和使皮肤变干。

6. Added to swimming pools, it can balance the pH and help keep water clear.

7. Sodium bicarbonate is an effective antacid, but is not recommended because it’s so high in sodium: 1,250 milligrams per teaspoon, and 1,100 milligrams in two tabletsof Alka-Seltzer. And it may cause acid rebound effect, in which case you end up with worse heartburn. And by the way: Some websites recommend taking sodium bicarbonate to bolster or restore your body’s acid/alkaline (pH) balance. This is nonsensical advice.
